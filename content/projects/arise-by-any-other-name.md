Arise by any other name is the first project of the collaborative series Passages of Babel. 
Samuel Mignot and Servane Briand worked simultaneously on text and book design in 2021-2022. Inspired by their on-going conversations on language and translation, Mignot wrote twelve stories/parables while Briand constructed an articulated tower that would become Passages of Babel and designed a book structure for Mignotâ€™s collection. The book is set in Adobe Caslon and Nueva Std, digitally printed on Arches paper. Mignot and Briand collaborated on icon imagery for the stories. Digital and hand drawn illustrations. Hand dyed hanji. Exposed spine coptic binding.
