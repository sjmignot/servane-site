With their twelve small books "Les Moches", Stéphanie Ferrat and Jean-Louis Giovannoni  put the spotlight on insects that nobody likes, cockroaches, aphids, woodlice, and other forms of life that pullulate close to us, if we dare to look.  In "trou d'eau", we encounter the weird universe of creatures that thrive in the uninviting yet fascinating water hole.
