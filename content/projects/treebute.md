I am lucky to live in a place where trees are plentiful and of many varieties. I also live in a place which is very diverse, with people from all over the world. Taking a stroll means being exposed to several different languages and cultures. When I decided to talk about the trees of my daily life -and put them in a box!-, I could not imagine how each one of them would be unique. I got drawn into their respective stories. The bark so much like the skin on our face, this outside layer, both protective and revealing, with mysteries whispered and narratives of time and seasons.
