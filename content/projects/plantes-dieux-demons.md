I finally made it to the [American Academy of Bookbinding](https://bookbindingacademy.org/) in Telluride last summer and learned a great contemporary parchement structure with [Rahel Scheufele](https://rscheufele.de/). It was first taught by [Edgard Claes](https://edgardclaes.com/) who has used this structure in much of his work especially with brillianty designed polycarbonate covers. It was fun to work with parchment especially as I could dye it to recall some of the vibrant colors used in the hallucinogenic illustrations! Rahel is a wonderful artist and teacher and it was a delight to be with her and everyone at AAB. Back in my studio I had fun finishing the design and incorporating botanical prints as additional inserts in the flyleaves.
