Inspired by long walks among the trees of Palo Alto and the Stanford campus and [the poetry of Charles Baudelaire](https://fleursdumal.org/poem/103). 

It is also a project I would like to make on a much larger scale as a public art installation so that we could walk around the tree/living pillars, marvel at their beauty and be transported, body and soul!
