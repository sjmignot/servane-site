A square box with rounded corners that contains nine books made of digitally printed photos, coated with beeswax and assembled with rivets. Some photos are ancient and date back to the late 19th century. All have been reworked digitally. 

I have been working for several years on round books and boxes. I also wanted to revisit the family album concept. This and my interest in family traits -my husband is a sleep researcher and does much work in genetics- led to a tic-tac-toe kind of box intended for our two sons! Nine books take the reader through a time journey of two families from the early days of photography to current times.
