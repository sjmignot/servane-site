Waves-2 is the second collaboration with French artist Louise Cagani. 
Paper is stitched, perforated, torn and pierced. Confronted with a mechanical, repeated, almost compulsive movement, it metamorphoses into an almost sculptural support, moving from flat surface to volume. Fragmented and torn, it is reassembled through weaving, like an attempt at repair. The resulting piece is both delicate and strong. It reminds us of the continuous energy of ocean waves. 
The open, cylindrical shape of the box is inspired by pipeline surfing inside a giant breaking wave.
