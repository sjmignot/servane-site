Fusion of text and colors, simultanéité, incredible rhythm and music, quasi cinematic effects transport the reader-viewer who embarks on this imaginary poetic voyage on the Transsibérien anchored in Paris. What could be more fun than doing another collaboration to bring “la fée électricité” and light into the artists’ book? 

Where the original La Prose was conceived more as a book-painting, I thought a book-experience of flipping the pages of the long and narrow accordion format encouraged one to read the poem and experience the beats and tempo of the train journey. Adding the LED map was a playful way to celebrate the European avant-garde, the creative freedom and stunning modernity of La Prose du Transsibérien.
