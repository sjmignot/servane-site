πr2 started as a collaborative project between a group of book artists (Bay Area Book Artists) and a group of printmakers (Printers At The Tannery). PAAT had a pile of reject prints that BABA shared randomly among participants. Rule is you had to make two books, one for PAAT and one for yourself. 

I got inspired to make more books from my own reject prints and I could not resist making a box inspired by the book structure. This developed as an on-going project in my studio for a few years as it shed new lights on the dialogue between prints and books. 

Since the original structure I developed (circular pages linked by rivets) also benefits from interacting with light, I also did a more sculptural installation of a whole series of these πr2books.

Looking for πr2 is both playful and meditative. It has no words. It has one box for three elements.  One has to choose what goes in and what stays out. Each translucent module can be very small, fitting in one’s palm or extending to over 6’. 

It is a very sensuous book that smells of beeswax, makes sounds as it folds and unfolds, catches the light. Looking for pir2 is another variation of my exploration of cycles through circular shapes and round books, no different in its obsessive attempt to defy beginning and end. It may just be slightly more mischievous. Only one box for three translucent modules. No words. Playful? Mindful? Silly?
