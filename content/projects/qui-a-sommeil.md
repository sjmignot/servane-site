Inspired by my husbandâ€™s research on sleep and our daily routine of making herbal tea at night time, Qui A Sommeil is a set of 3 books, 3 small pillows of comforting thoughts and smells that invite one to dream, sleep, hear the zzzzs of night owls and early birds, snoozers, snorers, dozers and nappers, light sleepers and sound sleepers, dreamers and insomniacs, sleeping beauties and narcoleptics, forty winkers and the sandman.

3 books made of recycled and stenciled tea bags. Japanese side stich with silk ribbons.  Each book is in its own box, an elegant structure with magnet closure, covered with a single piece of paper, an original design of Eleanore Ramsey.
