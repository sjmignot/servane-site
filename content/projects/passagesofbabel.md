Conversation is an art. It requires knowing and doubting, strong senses and a flexible mind, playfulness and depth or maybe just sheer curiosity. Passages of Babel is a place for conversation. It is particularly interested in language and translation. It focuses on the space in between two or several idiolects -in the words of George Steiner. It is a bare tower, exposed to the open skies and drafty. The walls fold/unfold to better migrate towards meaningful exchanges. Several of  these discussions will take the form of an artistsâ€™ book, exhibited in the tower and printed as series of zines/booklets and digital content to better spread ideas and continue the conversation. [Arise by Any Other Name](https://servanebriand.com/gallery/arise-by-any-other-name/) is the first of these collaborations, with poet and writer Samuel Mignot.
