Amanita Muscaria (amanite tue-mouches or fly agaric) becomes a decorative accent on the verso cover of a Tue-Mouche binding.  The same poisonous mushroom serves as a decorative accent on the spine of the Pianel-bound book. 
With Toxique, Sagan retells in poignant yet hilarious details the story of her detox after she took Palfium to recover from a car crash. Buffet’s illustrations are stunning and a perfect companion to Sagan’s unforgettable style.
