Amanita Muscaria (amanite tue-mouches or fly agaric) becomes a decorative accent on the verso cover of a Tue-Mouche binding. A play on words for the moving and funny memoir of Sagan’s detox after taking Palfium to recover from a car crash. Buffet’s illustrations are stunning and a perfect companion to Sagan’s unforgettable style.
