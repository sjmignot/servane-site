Another star book that celebrates the lovely Cotinus tree and a few others. As in [the previous one](https://servanebriand.com/gallery/cotinus/), this book mixes botanical prints and hand dyed papers. The accordion structure is playful yet invites the reader to discover the delicate yet intense lines and colors of the printed foliage.
