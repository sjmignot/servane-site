I continued my investigations in botanical printing on Korean and Japanese papers. As summer progressed and sunflowers showed up at my farmers' market, I started adding them to prints. They are a bit more difficult to handle as they are so thick compared to other flowers but I loved the results I was getting and made several prints using both sides of the paper. Then I printed on linen so I could make book cloth for a book. Et voil√†:)
