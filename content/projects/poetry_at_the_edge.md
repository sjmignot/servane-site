Poetry at the Edge, Five Contemporary California Poets. A project of the Book Club of California, printed by Classic Letterpress in Ojai, California, Poetry at the Edge  was edited by Carolee Campbell, who also contributed two photographs of the California  seaside. It features poets Kay Ryan, Joseph Stroud, Gary Young, Martha Ronk, and Michael Hannon. This edition also includes a broadside with the poem Hermits by Kay Ryan. 

The various poems in the books take us to many different places but I was particularly  taken by Campbell's illustration of the California coast. As a native of Brittany, I naturally associate West with Ocean. This informed my choice of beige and grey blue colors to evoke the stunning coast of the Pacific Ocean. While the sand dollar with its five ambulacra and petaloid pattern is a lovely symbol for the five poets who were chosen by Campbell to represent the Edge. What can we discover at the edge, beyond waves, water, and the ever changing horizon?
