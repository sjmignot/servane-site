The Cynthia Thames barge was lost at sea while carrying thousands of empty clay bottles to be refilled at the Apollinaris water company in Remagen, Germany, on the Rhine. It was its fiftieth voyage doing so like may other barges employed by the Germany company.
 
I made the 19th century style bookcloth with wheat paste and natural dyes to obtain a warm red reminiscent of the Thames barge sails. The endsheets are printed with images of the Apollinaris clay bottles similar to those transported in the hull of the Cynthia barge. 

Incidentally, Apollinaris water was served on the Titanic, and the brand now belonds to Coca Cola.
