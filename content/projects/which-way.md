When I sailed as a kid, there was no GPS and we used navigation plotters to trace triangles on nautical charts and help approximate our location. Over the years as we practiced on familiar territories the over folded overstudied charts became complex blue/white/yellow forests of tiny triangles. Sometimes and especially in times of transition I dream I have a small compass that gently points my mind into a direction or another. As the book opens into a square, we can re-orient or change our bearings but the games continues and the triangle returns providing more questions and suggesting other ways.
