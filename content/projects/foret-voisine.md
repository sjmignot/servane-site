Nearby yet mysterious is the forest we discover through the poetic and enchanting descriptions of Genevoix and the gorgeous etchings of Beaufrère. Among the many metamorphoses and secrets of the living forest is the ancient making of charcoal which I used to draw on the book and imagined again as I mixed words and images to burn the leather.The multiple and various inhabitants of the forest are all summed up in the tiny red throat bird onlayed on the back and inspired by a watercolor of Genevoix.
