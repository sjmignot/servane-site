Threads of life interweaves the stories of the three fates, the origin of biological life, and the development of human communication. It does not, however, focus on their individual histories, pondering instead the latent dialogue that language itself has created between them.

Text and textile share the same etymological root. A key process in the cell cycle, mitosis, derives its name from the Greek word mitos, thread. The book plays with the origin of words and how they echo each other when used in science or in the arts to convey various ways of analyzing the world. It offers multiple interpretations through its multiple drawers which are vertically organized. The bottom drawers represent DNA, the essential component of life, the next one, cells….and the upper one contains a more complex story in the form of an accordion book. 

Together the three Moirai -and their polymeric meristics- remind us of all spinners and weavers and the threads we combine to create fanciful yarns.
