A collaboration with friend and book artist Karen Rush. This book is dedicated to our friend and teacher, artist Kent Manske and tells a crazy story about a fictional group of students who follow Kent on a learning journey. Karen and I were interested in exploring the weird space that happens in translation and to riff of the absurdity and farcical effects that occur there. We used only popular expressions (mostly French and English) to create the narrative and then illustrated them in a DADA spirit, using watercolor backgrounds and collages. Then the images were scanned and digitally printed.
