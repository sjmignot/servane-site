Numinous Cranes explores various spiritual traditions and tries to understand the need for prayer and meditation. The bible reader, the crane folder, each one of us long for the meaningful and walk the mysterious line between spiritual and secular. By deconstructing the sacred book and transforming it into a healing project, I created my own meditative journey. By incorporating words and beeswax in the folded structures and squaring the nests, I escaped from orthodoxy. By assembling the birds, you create the narrative!
