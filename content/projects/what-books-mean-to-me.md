What books mean to me” is the second project of the Be A Page in A Book series which invites people in our community to reflect on a specific topic in the form of a short comic strip. We then curate all pages into a collaborative book.

“What books mean to me” is also an open question with numerous answers.  The book features diverse voices as we reached out to our peers, friends, neighbors and family members, near and far away. It involves book lovers, book makers, talented cartoonists, amateur artists, writers, poets, voracious readers, intimidated sketch artists, students, dreamers and many more and everyone is a page in this book!

These collection of all pages into an artists’ book was edited, printed, and hand-bound by Daniele Archambault, Servane Briand and Paloma Lucas at Cubberley Artist Studios in Palo Alto, California
