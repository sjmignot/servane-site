Collaborative Comic Book Project – On Veterans’ Day 2017, three artists (Paloma Lucas, Servane Briand & Daniele Archambault) invited members of the community to remember and honor veterans by participating in a collaborative comic book project. The original 90 pages of short comics, written and drawn by adults, students and children, were edited and hand-bound into an artists’ book and , a collective expression of gratitude and celebration of freedom and peace. The stories are told by people of several countries, and focus on various wars all over the world and over a span of many years. Despite their diversity of style and content, the pages were grouped into three book: Stories, Memories, and Imageries.
