Threads of life interweaves the stories of the three fates, the origin of life, genetics and the development of human communication. It explores our endless search for meaning through arts and sciences and the stories we tell ourselves.  
Threads of Life -Codex 2022 continues the [original project](https://servanebriand.com/gallery/filsdelavie/) made in 2021 by Servane Briand. Excerpts of the original work were turned into three mini books, nested in a box.
