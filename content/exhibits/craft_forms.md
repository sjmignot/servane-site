The 28th edition of the famous international contemporary craft exhibition was juried by Jean McLaughlin and is showing at the Wayne Center until late January. She says of the final selection from a pool of around five hundred artists, â€œI found the entries to be incredibly strong and varied in approaches. Certainly several shows could be made of the works submitted. After looking over and over at the works and reading the statements, I have become quite attached to them.
Making cuts in the first round was hard but the final round was like turning away old friends."
