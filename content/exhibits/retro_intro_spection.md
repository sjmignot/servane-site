Artists are frequently inspired by the past and aim to make work which speaks to future audiences, subsequent generations. Tandem processes of introspective questioning and retrospective storytelling often come together in the artist book format—giving reader and creator the opportunity for personal reflection. Artists books tell us stories by using narrative, structure, materials.

(retro)(intro)spection explores the crossroads where artists books and artistic process intersect. When do our amorphous ideas become real, at what point? What is the role of introspection and one’s personal past when applied to artists books? In the act of looking back as well as in, artists are inspired by their body of work, regarding the path or discovering the throughine which brings them to the present.
