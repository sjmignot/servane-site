description: "The exhibition embraces exactly this perspective by creating a seamless fluidity of gender, time, identity, contexts, definitions and conventions in which extremely decorative aesthetics coexists with a minimalistic one. There is a natural osmosis of light and darkness, curves and straight lines, shine and matt, light and heavy, precious and simple. Function and Beauty are interconnected with grace and profound truth within the same narration which, through the love of oddities, of the paradoxical, the grotesque, virtuosity and exaltation, ultimately ends up being the “the longest and most charming love letter” ever written."
