A Design Binding is a singularly considered and beautifully executed book covering—a unique work of art in the form of the book. This exhibition features a juried collection of recently made books submitted from around the world, a definitive statement on excellence in fine binding today.

OPEN • SET is a competition and exhibition, a triennial event featuring finely crafted design bindings. Sponsored by the American Academy of Bookbinding, it is designed to encourage both new binders and professionals, and is open to binders around the world. This title reflects the two categories in which the binders compete—the Open Category, in which the artist chooses which textblock to bind, and the Set Category, in which participants bind the same textblock.

All entries were reviewed by a blind jury of three professional binders. The three members of the jury are Monique Lallier, Mark Esser, and Patricia Owen.
