I went to Syria in December 2009, two years before the start of the civil war. I took this picture on Christmas Day 2009, in a village between Latakia and Aleppo.The Syrian conflict is a tragedy of civil war, torture, human rights violations and humanitarian disaster.

The stamp has a symbolic meaning, while the number 73 refers to the estimated number of dead in this civil war (73,000 was UN estimate when I printed the image; it is now around 450.000) ). And there are over 4 million refugees. March 15, 2011 marks the beginning of the war.The perforations on the stamp suggest the crenelated walls on the stunning citadels that date back to the medieval period.
