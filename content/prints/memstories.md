is inspired by a long lasting interest in the nuts and bolts of memory. According to wikipedia, memory is the range of processes by which information is encoded, stored and retrieved. These three aspects are therefore essential to the understanding of memory. I tried to use symbols that woud address all three aspects of this memory process. I combined two images, one of a castle (palace!), one of an electrical power unit (fenced!). It can be interpreted in multiple and various directions. Just to name a few, the castle is in ruins (memories are altered with age, however some remain, beautiful, the foundations persist as is the case for childhood memories with older people affected for example by Alzheimer). The castle is also a symbol for the memory palace (a spatial mnemonic also called methods of loci and described in Rhetorica ad Herrenium).The brain is an electrical and chemical machine that fires all the time! 

From the Danger/High Voltage sign, I kept only the TAG part as tagging is a way we encode to store and retrieve (in brains and computers!) The fence is a symbol of guarded access (difficulty to access memories, guarding against dangerous memories, etcâ€¦)
