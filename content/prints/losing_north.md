Losing North is inspired by Nancy Huston's 2002 book of the same title.

Born in Canada, Huston moved to France when she was 20. She writes in French and self translates to English. One of the themes she explores is the feeling of in-betweenness and the complexities of navigating distinct cultural identities.

In its deconstructive/reconstructive approach, screen printing was a perfect process for that specific print. It mirrors the various layers of identities that come together to form the final image.
