Losing North is by Nancy Huston's book of the same title. 

Huston lives in France, having moved there from Canada when she was 20. One of the themes she explores is the feeling of in-betweenness and the complexities of navigating distinct cultural identities.

In its deconstructive/reconstructive approach, screen printing was a very interesting process that also suggest the various layers of identities that come together to result in the final image.
