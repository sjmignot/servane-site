process: Botanical printing, encaustic, gold leaf
edition: 1 of 1

Inspired by Japanese Kintsugi art, I push the limits in my hiatus series. As I print with plants on very fine mulberry paper, I may end up with torn fragments. By adding beeswax, I increase the transparency to expose the various layers then I add gold leaf in the gaps created in the original print.
