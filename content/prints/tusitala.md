Tusitala is the Samoan name taken by Robert Louis Stevenson, which means "teller of tales". It is also a jumping spider that was first described by George and Elizabeth Peckham in 1902.  
This ten layers screenprint explores the power of stories and what happens when you take elements upside down or turn them around changing the perspective, therefore, sometimes, the outcome.
