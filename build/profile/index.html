		<p class="first-section__text first-section__text--left"> Living in Silicon Valley and making artists’ books is exhilarating. When some may blame the digital revolution for the demise of the book, one could also argue that it allows the extraordinary vitality of book arts. I am an enthusiastic reader and have always loved books. This naturally led me to want to make my own. 
		</p>
		<p class="first-section__text first-section__text--right"> In creating a book, I enjoy the ability to work from different perspectives and working in media as diverse as papermaking, printmaking, bookbinding, as well as collaborating with poets, makers and artists. I like that inspiration can arise from different places but that in the end the pieces must fit together, a bit like a puzzle. I like that I get to use very ancient tools and techniques and the latest technology too. And often, experments lead to new collaborations! It’s a wonderful challenge and the narrative is always moving forward.</p>

		<p class="second-section__text"> In pursuing the book as art object, I am also interested in what happens when the object gets manipulated. The reader/viewer invents yet another narrative. He or she tells a story and while I may not capture it, I am curious at what it is and what if? I like to explore what happens in this territory. I cherish our ability to be moved by works of art and I love witnessing it. </p>
