When some may  blame the digital revolution  for the demise of the book, one could also argue that it allows for the extraordinary vitality of book arts. I am an  enthusiastic reader and have always loved books. This naturally led me to want to make my own.</p>
		<p class="first-section__text first-section__text--right"> This naturally led me to  want to make my own. In creating a book, I enjoy the ability to work from these different perspectives and working in media as diverse as papermaking, printmaking, bookbinding.

		<p class="second-section__text"> In pursuing the book as art object. I am also interested in what happens when the object gets manipulated. The reader/viewer invents yet another narrative. He or she tells a story and while I may not capture it. I am curious at what it is and what if? I like to explore what happens in this territory. I cherish our ability to be moved by works of art and I love witnessing it. </p>
