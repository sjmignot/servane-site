		<p>This print is inspired by an artist book Numinous Cranes I made in 2014 (which is now part of the University of North Texas Willis Library's Rare Books Collection) and belongs to a series of prints that celebrate the art of folding (origami) and were created and printed at Cubberley studio E3 in summer 2015. </p>
<p>When Numinous Cranes was finished, it flew to Texas for an artists’ book exhibition and never came back. I missed the cranes and decided to capture them again this time in print. That same summer, some images of Sergej Paradžanov's movie “ the color of pomegranates kept playing in my head, especially the scene when the young poet is surrounded by books on the roof of the monastery and it looks like books and boy will just fly off in the wind.  I experimented with chine collé using washi (Japanese kozo paper) for both the print and the collaged part. And I added beeswax for more transparency.</p>
